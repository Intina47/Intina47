### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ntina, a passionate computer science student in my third year of studies. I have a keen interest in exploring various fields of computer science, and currently, I'm focused on expanding my knowledge in machine learning.

ðŸ“š Throughout my coursework, I've gained a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and data structures. However, I'm always eager to learn new skills, and machine learning has captured my attention as an exciting and rapidly growing field.

ðŸ¤– I'm currently diving into the world of machine learning, exploring concepts like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. I'm enjoying working with libraries such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn, and I'm excited to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems.

ðŸŒ± Besides machine learning, I'm also interested in software development, web development, and data science. I enjoy collaborating on open-source projects and contributing to the tech community.

ðŸ’¡ This GitHub profile serves as a space where I share my projects, experiments, and learnings. Feel free to explore my repositories and provide feedback or suggestions. Let's connect and learn together!

ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at isaiahntina47@gmail.com. I'm always open to discussions, collaborations, and learning opportunities.

Let's embrace the journey of continuous learning and exploration in the fascinating world of computer science and machine learning! ðŸš€
