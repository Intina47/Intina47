### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Am Ntina. I code when am feeling bored, happy, tired or even sad. There's something about opening up that code editor that gives me peace and gives my life a purpose.

### My Late Night Weekend Projects

1. **GitHub Followers Manager**

ðŸš€As it appears, you don't need much to be a developer, all you need is a growth mindset, be ready to be challenged in the most extreme possible way, be consistent in terms of practice as it helps you keep up with the ever changing dynamics and best of them all love it.
