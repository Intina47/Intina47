Hello, darlings — I’m Ntina 👋

I code in every emotional state known to mankind. Bored? I code.

Happy? I code.
Sad? Absolutely coding.
Tired? Oh honey, that’s when the best bugs are born.

There’s just something magical about cracking open a code editor — like stepping onto a tiny digital stage where everything finally makes sense.
Coding gives me peace, purpose, and the occasional existential crisis… but in a fun way!

Stick around, browse the repos, and if something makes you smile — go on, give it a star. Be generous. Make your mother proud.
